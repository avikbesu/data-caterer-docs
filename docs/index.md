Using Data Caterer, you have the ability to generate production like data based on any source/target system whether it
be a CSV file, database table, etc. anywhere you want the data to be. Whether it be in a test environment or even in
your local laptop.
Just define your data source connections and data will be generated.
It can also be manually altered to produce data or scenarios the way you want.
