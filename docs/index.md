Data Caterer is a metadata driven data generation tool that aids in creating production like data across batch and event
data systems. You can then clean up the generated data or run data validations to ensure your systems have ingested it
as expected. Use the Java, Scala API, or YAML files to help with setup or customisation that are all run via Docker.

Main features of the data generator include:

- :material-card-search: Metadata discovery
- :material-file: Batch or :material-circle-multiple: event data generation
- :material-vector-difference-ba: Maintain referential integrity across any dataset
- :material-projector-screen-variant-outline: Create custom data generation scenarios
- :material-delete-sweep: Clean up generated data
- :material-check: Validate data
