# Roadmap

- Support for other data sources
    - GCP and Azure related data services, Delta, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ
- Metadata discovery for HTTP, JMS
- :white_check_mark: API for developers and testers
- UI for metadata and data generation
- :white_check_mark: Report for data generated and validation rules
- Metadata stored in database
- Integration with existing metadata services (i.e. Amundsen, Datahub, Schema Registry)
    - Populate metadata back to metadata services
    - Can follow OpenLineage Spec found [**here**](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/blob/main/spec/OpenLineage.md#standard-facets)
- Data dictionary
    - Business definitions of fields that can be referenced for metadata across all data sources
- :white_check_mark: Verification rules after data generation
- :white_check_mark: Validation waiting conditions
    - Webhook
    - File exists
    - Data exists via SQL expression
    - Pause
- Extend validation types
    - Aggregates (sum of amount per account is > 500)
    - Ordering (transactions are ordered by date)
    - Relationship (at least one account entry in history table per account in accounts table)
    - Data profile (how close the generated data profile is compared to the expected data profile)
- Extend count
    - Cover all possible cases (i.e. record for each combination of oneOf values, positive/negative values etc.)
    - Similar to edge cases
- Alerting
- Overriding tasks
    - Can customise tasks without copying whole schema definitions
    - Easier to create scenarios
- Integration with Great Expectations
    - Data validations can reference expectations
- Gradle plugin
- Metadata improvements
    - PII detection (can integrate with [Presidio](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/analyzer/))
    - Relationship detection across data sources
    - SQL generation
    - Ordering information
- Code generation
- Schema generation from Scala/Java class
- Ordering within data sources that support order for insertion
